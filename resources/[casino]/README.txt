Online Interiors README - Version 0.3

Information -
(I created none of these scripts! You can find who did in the CREDITS.txt!)
- I basically did all the work of coords and ipl interior stuff so you don't have to. (Aren't I nice!)
- I have everything in this folder you need.

READ THIS CAREFULLY!

How to Install -
1.) Drag and Drop the folder labeled "[online_interiors]" into your resource folder.
2.) (Optional) If you do not want the Casino, delete the folder "[casino]" located in the "[maps]" folder, then remove casino resources from the resource list below.
3.) Last but not least, I saved you from having to type for the rest of the night. Copy the text from the resource list below into your “server.cfg”.
4.) Be happy with yourself!

Note from Cloudy -
I wanted to do this because I never really saw something with Teleports and Blips and most of the working online interiors for people without ESX or VRP.
I hope you can enjoy, I put in a lot of hours to complete this. Please expect there to be updates.
Also, I put in a lot of work so please don’t go around saying you did all of this stuff, because you didn’t.
